# Git Attributes file for consistent handling across different environments

# Auto-detect text files and perform LF normalization in the repository.
# On checkout, files will use the OS's default line ending (CRLF on Windows, LF on Linux/macOS).
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly declare text files we know should be normalized.
# Enforcing 'eol=lf' ensures that these files ALWAYS have LF line endings in the repository
# and when checked out on non-Windows systems. On Windows checkout, Git will convert to CRLF.
